Pay attention to what my kid is interested in. Encourage it and provide tools to reveal the interest. 

For example, if she express an interest in learning how to play guitar, give her the tools like finding a tutor, music classes, or online classes.

Give her an opportunity to choose her own interests. And support her throughout her journey.
