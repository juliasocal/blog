> The feeling of being valuable - "I am a valuable person" - is essential to mental health and is a cornerstone of self-discipline. It is a direct product of parental love. 

> As a result of the experience of consistent parental love and caring throughout childhood, such fortunate children will enter adulthood not only with a deep internal sense of their own value but also with a deep internal sense of security. 

Give my child sense of security by constantly reminding her that we aren't going to leave her behind, and that we will come back to get her.
