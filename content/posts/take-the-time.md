Sometimes I find myself rushing through a problem I need to solve and I end up not being satisfied with the solution or myself. I would think that I am not good enough to solve this problem. 

The book "The Road Less Traveled" made me think that I just don't take the time. 

I want to remind myself to take the time, to examine the problem, become comfortable with the problem, give it some time to sink. And only then find a solution for it. I think I will be more happy with myself too.
